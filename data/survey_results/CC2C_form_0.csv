ObjectID,GlobalID,"I invite you to take part in my research study ""How are cycling practices shaped by cycling infrastructure? Insights from the Clontarf to City Centre cycleway"". Before you decide to take part, please take time to read the following information carefully. Ask questions if anything you read is not clear or if you would like more information.",I am a student at Trinity College Dublin undertaking research on cycling in Dublin as part of my dissertation in the Master of Science Smart & Sustainable Cities course. This survey aims to understand how people use the new Clontarf to City Centre cycleway and how it has influenced their cycling experience. I hope to then embed these insights into the wider academic discussion around cycling practices and perceptions in cities.,Taking part in this survey will involve answering questions about your cycling habits in general and your cycling practices on the Clontarf to City Centre cycleway specifically. Completing the survey is estimated to take 10-15 min. This survey will be open to participation until the 25th of June 2025.,"Participation is completely voluntary, and you have the right to withdraw at any time while taking the survey. All responses are anonymous. The collected data will be stored on Trinity College Dublin servers for the duration of my studies and be retained for 2 years before being deleted. Only myself and my supervisors will have access to this data. The results of this study will be used in my dissertation and may be used at student conferences in the future.","For any inquiries, please contact Emma Hegarty via e-mail hegartem@tcd.ie.",Which age bracket do you fall into?,Please select your gender.,Please select your ethnicity.,Please specify other.,What is your current employment status?,What is your highest educational attainment?,Does someone in your household own a car?,Do you own a bike?,Do you use bike sharing services like DublinBikes?,Have you used the Bike-To-Work scheme?,Do you usually start cycling trips from home?,Which Dublin district do you live in?,In which Dublin district do you usually start your cycling trips?,For which purposes do you usually cycle?,Please specify other.,What is your primary purpose for cycling?,Which Dublin district is your primary destination located in?,Are there bicycle parking facilities at your primary destination?,On how many days per week do you usually cycle?,For how long have you been cycling regularly?,Have you cycled regularly in the past?,"Is there a specfic reason you stopped cycling regularly and if yes, what is it?",Please specify other.,Do you use safety accessories when cycling?,Do you regularly maintain your bicycle?,Do you cycle with children under the age of 16?,"The Clontarf to City Centre cycleway stretches from Clontarf Road at the junction with Alfie Byrne Road to Amiens Street at the junction with Talbot Street, as seen in the map below.",Have you used the new Clontarf to City Centre cycleway as a cyclist?,On how many days per week do you use the new cycleway?,Did you cycle along this road before the cycleway was added?,"How has your sense of safety changed while cycling, since the introduction of the cycleway?","How has your perception of speed changed while cycling, since the introduction of the cycleway?","How has your level of stress changed while cycling, since the introduction of the cycleway?","How has your sense of safety changed while cycling, compared to your previous route?","How has your perception of speed changed while cycling, compared to your previous route?","How has your level of stress changed while cycling, compared to your previous route?",Which factors in the environment do you find most stressful while cycling?,Are there sections of the cycleway where you find it to be safer/more efficient to leave the cycleway or not follow the road rules for cyclists?,For which reasons do you leave the cycleway/break the rules?,Please specify other.,Number of Stops,Would you like to answer some additional questions on your cycling experience?,How does the section of your route on the Clontarf to Conolloy cycleway compare to sections not on the cycleway?

Without question, this exit of the cycleway onto the roadway changes the demands of cycling radically from essentially full (if narrow) protection from motor traffic to complete exposure to bus drivers and (often aggressive) taxi drivers on a very wide road way clearly prioritising car traffic.

Also the majority of cyclists breaking traffic lights when it is green for pedestrians - including when pedestrians are visibly crossing ahead. While this may be an indicator of a shift toward a more interpersonally negotiated (rather than mechanically regulated) mobility order along this route, I have seen nearly total inattention by cyclists toward the floating bus stops when pedestrians might be preparing to cross.
